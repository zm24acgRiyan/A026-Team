Toss Outcome and Match Winner Analysis
This repository contains the code, data visualizations, and report for a project analyzing the impact of toss outcomes (whether a team won the toss or not) on match outcomes (whether the team won or lost the match).

Project Goals:

Analyze the relationship between the toss outcome (Toss Winner vs Toss Loser) and match outcomes (Match Winner vs Match Loser).
Explore if thereâ€™s a significant statistical difference in the proportions of matches won by teams that won the toss compared to teams that lost the toss.
Visualize the proportion of matches won by toss winners and toss losers.
